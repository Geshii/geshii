# $~ nano Hello.txt
Hey, welcome to my page ! Are you looking for some info about me ? You're at the right place !

## Who are you ?
I'm Geshi. I started dev in middle school, and now I'm contributing to a lot of open-source projects. 

I'm not currently working full-time because I'm a student. I'm really happy to work with a lot of people in a lot of projects, big or small (such as osu!, kitsu-desktop, mewo, and more !)

# How to support you ?

You can support me using Github's sponsorship system. Just click on the sponsor button and it should be good ! (Note: The button is unavailable since I need to fix some stuff).
If you want to support me with crypto, or other, just DM me on twitter and I'll send you an adress.
